# P21RepComp
Tool to compare multiple P21 reports and to merge comments in the Issue Summary table. 

## How to Start
Copy the app.R and the tool.R file in the same folder on your system. Run the app.R file on your R-Console or on R-Studio.
If you use a non RStudio setting uncomment line 13 and commend line 11 out, to set the working directory to the right folder, if 
the program does not work. 


## How to Use
###Show & Compare Mode
When the programme is started, the compare mode is automatically selected. In the second menu item "Select P21 Reports", any number of reports can be selected using browse. The remaining buttons have the following function.

Search Fields.
Each column has his own search field. Moreover there is a general search window, to address all columns.
All fields support standard regEx expressions. If you need help, I recommend (https://regexr.com/).
